	from https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html:

		Context.Provider

		 Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes

		 Accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.

		 All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Providerâ€™s value prop changes. The propagation from Provider to its descendant consumers is not subject to the shouldComponentUpdate method, so the consumer is updated even when an ancestor component bails out of the update.
		*/

	// pass in any variables and functions you want access to in child components (aka Consumers)

		count: count,
